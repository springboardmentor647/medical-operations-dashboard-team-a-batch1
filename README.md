## Milestone 2 - Patient Flow & Service Demand Intelligence

### 1. Project Overview
Milestone 2 focuses on transforming the cleaned healthcare datasets prepared during Milestone 1 into meaningful operational insights. The team performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), KPI generation, trend analysis, visualization, and dashboard development to support healthcare operational decision-making.

### 2. Milestone 2 Objective
The main objective of Milestone 2 is to analyze patient flow and healthcare service demand and convert the results into interactive dashboard insights.

#### Objectives
* Analyze admission and discharge patterns.
* Analyze department-wise patient workload.
* Monitor treatment and service demand.
* Identify operational bottlenecks and capacity strain.
* Analyze surgery workload.
* Generate KPIs and trends.
* Develop visualizations for dashboard integration.

### 3. Business Questions
Milestone 2 is organized around six core business questions:
1. Admission Trends
2. Department-wise Patient Load
3. Patient Discharge & Flow
4. Treatment & Service Demand
5. Bottlenecks & Capacity Strain
6. Surgery Workload

Each business question is handled by one Type A and one Type B team member.

---

### 4. Task Division

| Business Question | Type A - Analysis | Type B - Visualization |
|---|---|---|
| Admission Trends | Divya | Nafisa |
| Department-wise Patient Load | Srivalli | Tanvi |
| Patient Discharge & Flow | Sowmitha | Keerthi |
| Treatment & Service Demand | Abhinay | Sarthak |
| Bottlenecks & Capacity Strain | Sarthak | Sarthak |
| Surgery Workload | Deepika | Divya |
| Dashboard Integration | Nafisa | - |
| Documentation | Sowmitha | - |

Type A members perform EDA and KPI analysis, while Type B members convert the findings into visualizations and dashboard components.

---

### 5. Datasets Used

* **Admission Trends:** admissions_clean.csv
* **Department-wise Patient Load:** admissions_clean.csv, departments_clean.csv
* **Patient Discharge & Flow:** admissions_clean.csv
* **Treatment & Service Demand:** lab_results_clean.csv, billing_clean.csv
* **Bottlenecks & Capacity Strain:** admissions_clean.csv, doctors_preprocessed.csv, departments_clean.csv
* **Surgery Workload:** surgeries_clean_fixed.csv

---

### 6. Analysis Methodology
The Milestone 2 workflow follows:
Data Loading -> Data Validation -> Exploratory Data Analysis -> KPI Generation -> Trend Analysis -> Findings -> Visualization -> Dashboard Integration

Python and Pandas are used for data analysis and KPI generation.

---

### 7. Patient Discharge & Flow Analysis
For the Patient Discharge & Flow business question, the analysis uses:
* Discharge_Date
* Status
* Length_of_Stay_Days

The analysis focuses on the admission-to-discharge timeline and patient status transitions. Since no movement or transfer log is available, ward-to-ward patient movement is not analyzed.

#### KPIs Generated
* Total Patients
* Average Length of Stay
* Discharge Rate
* Patient Status Distribution
* Monthly Admissions
* Monthly Discharges
* Department-wise Admissions
* Department-wise Discharges
* Department-wise Discharge Rate

#### Key Results
* Total Patients: 5,000
* Average Length of Stay: 5.52 days
* Discharge Rate: 24.28%
* Critical Patients: 1,279
* Under Treatment: 1,272
* Recovered Patients: 1,235
* Discharged Patients: 1,214
* Highest Monthly Admissions: July - 524
* Highest Monthly Discharges: March - 584
* Highest Department Admissions: D015 - 335
* Highest Department Discharge Rate: D004 - 30.32%

---

### 8. Visualization
The Type B members use the KPI outputs and findings from Type A analysis to create dashboard visualizations. Planned visualizations include:
* Admission trend charts
* Department-wise workload charts
* Patient status distribution
* Monthly admission and discharge trends
* Length of Stay analysis
* Treatment and service demand charts
* Bottleneck and capacity indicators
* Surgery workload visualizations

---

### 9. Tools & Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Plotly / Dash or Power BI
* Google Colab
* Git & GitHub

---

### 10. GitHub Workflow
The team uses GitHub for collaborative development and documentation:
Clone Repository -> Create/Use Working Branch -> Perform Analysis -> Commit Changes -> Push Changes -> Review/Integrate -> Dashboard Assembly

Work is pushed regularly so that dashboard integration can happen smoothly.

---

### 11. Challenges & Solutions
* **Challenge 1: Different Business Questions**
  * Solution: Tasks were divided into six business questions with dedicated Type A and Type B members.
* **Challenge 2: Missing Patient Movement Data**
  * Solution: Patient flow was analyzed using admission-to-discharge timelines and status transitions since no transfer logs existed.
* **Challenge 3: Multiple Dataset Requirements**
  * Solution: Relevant datasets were mapped to each business question and joined where required.
* **Challenge 4: Dashboard Integration**
  * Solution: Type A members provide KPI numbers and findings to Type B members for visualization and dashboard integration.

---

### 12. Milestone 2 Deliverables

### 10. Conclusion
Milestone 3 successfully delivers the Resource Utilization & Capacity Intelligence Module, completing the analytical foundation of the Healthcare Operations Intelligence Dashboard. By integrating hospital bed capacity benchmarks, doctor staffing records, and admissions data across departments, this module enables operational decision-makers to:
* Identify departments operating near or above critical capacity thresholds.
* Highlight staffing and workforce imbalances across specialized hospital departments.
* Measure and close operational capacity gaps against established healthcare benchmarks.
* Provide an interactive, unified 5-page decision analytics platform supporting data-driven clinical and operational management.
